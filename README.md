## Project Description

College students often face significant stress from managing multiple aspects of their lives, such
as financial pressures, food insecurity, mental health struggles, and everyday responsibilities.
These challenges can become overwhelming, leading to heightened stress and negatively
impacting their well-being. Without the right tools and support, it can be difficult to balance these
demands effectively. Develop a Support Hub that focuses on helping individuals manage life’s
stressors. The platform provides tailored tools and resources in key areas allowing users to
reduce stress and improve their overall quality of life.

While this system is not required to be developed to be accessed via the web, it must be able to
be run on multiple different machines while accessing a central database (you will run a
database locally for testing and development, but it should function as if you were connecting to
a database on a central server).

### Course Specifications:

- Implents user authentication
- Implements a dynamic database of user and item data
- Implements one or more “operations” involving some form of frontend-backend-database
  communication

### Course Expectations:

- Databases can use any existing dataset or have dummy data. Databases using datasets
  should have at least 100 items. There can be exceptions based on the specific project.
- New User creation/registration should be available
- UI design should contain elements commonly found or expected such as a user profile,
  login, logout.
- Consideration for design aesthetics
- System should be dynamic and responsive
